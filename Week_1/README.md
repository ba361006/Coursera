- Sampling: 

    When we turn an analog signal or image to a digital signal or image, we are not going to capture every signal or image level of grey that reflected from the object, we are just simply discretizing the signal or image. We call this process sampling.

- Quantization:

    We call the process that giving the signal or image a certain grey value after sampling
    quantization.
